Solution expected:
This code is already in a working version. You need to identify the opportunites to refactor the solution so that the codebase will be cleaner and testable. You can consider below pointers for the refactoring.

1. Make use of appropriate patterns and principles 
2. Improve the readability and maintanability of the code
3. Make sure that unit tests are covering ~100% of your code
4. Do no over-engineer the things (no use of any framework than nUnit and MOQ is allowed)
5. All the unit test cases must pass
